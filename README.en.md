# ZhuaTech Hospital Information System

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for healthcare, clinical, and laboratory information management.

ZhuaTech Hospital Information System provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for healthcare, clinical, and laboratory information management. It is designed for healthcare institutions, laboratories, clinical teams, and authorized operators, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise hospital information system, self-hosted hospital information system, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Product Scope

- **Primary users:** Healthcare institutions, laboratories, clinical teams, and authorized operators.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Capability Map

- **Patient or subject records** — Manage patient or subject records with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Clinical and laboratory workflows** — Coordinate clinical and laboratory workflows through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Controlled results and reports** — Track controlled results and reports metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Data validation and traceability** — Preserve data validation and traceability evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Role-based operational workspaces** — Expose role-based operational workspaces in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Compliance-oriented audit history** — Connect compliance-oriented audit history to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Technology Baseline

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `docs/` — architecture, operations, screenshots, and supporting documentation
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Run Locally

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Review `compose.yaml` before changing published ports, storage paths, or production credentials.

## Verification

Run the checks supported by this repository before changing or deploying it:

```bash
cd backend && mvn test
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
```

## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.
